# Mars Rover V2 Project Log
##### POV: N3RDIUM

[23/08/2024]
- Wrote the boilerplate code
- Long time no see, Python! (I've been doing more Rust stuff lately)
- Got some basic hello world scripts running on both the PC and the Pi
- Big problem to the project: how do I power this thing with a battery?
