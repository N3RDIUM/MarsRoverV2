# MarsRoverV2
Code for my second Mars Rover project for the annual science fair at my school (ik its kinda overkill, but yes)

## Hardware Requirements
1. A desktop/laptop (Linux*)
2. A Raspberry Pi (preferably a 5*)

##### *No, I'm not biased towards these things. The code has only been tested on the platforms I recommend, which is why I recommend users to use them. If you're cool with tweaking and troubleshooting, please do try this on other platforms and contribute!

## How to run
Make TWO clones of this repository. One on your laptop/desktop (how else are you going to control it?) and one on your Raspberry Pi.

### On your desktop/laptop (LINUX)
```git clone https://github.com/n3rdium/MarsRoverV2.git
cd MarsRoverV2
python3 -m venv .venv
./launcher.sh
```

### On your shiny Raspberry Pi
```git clone https://github.com/n3rdium/MarsRoverV2.git
cd MarsRoverV2
python3 -m venv .venv
./launcher-raspi.sh
```
